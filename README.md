🚀 New tool alert for surveyors, GIS pros & anyone who wrangles spatial data!

I’m excited to share SpatialConvert – a lightweight Windows app that makes it painless to move data between:

DXF ⇌ KMZ/KML

SHP ⇌ KMZ/KML

Key highlights

 ⚙️ 1-click conversions (no command-line)

 🗺️ Supports points and linework / closed polylines

 🌍 WGS-84 UTM zones built-in

 📐 Keeps drawing units in meters end-to-end

 🖼️ Simple, no-install EXE

I built this to speed up field-to-Google Earth checks for my own projects—now I’m making it available to the community. Would love your feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports.

Big thanks to open-source heroes #netDxf, #SharpKml, #NetTopologySuite & #DotSpatial for the heavy lifting under the hood.
